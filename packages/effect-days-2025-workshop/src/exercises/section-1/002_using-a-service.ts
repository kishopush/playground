/**
 * **Todo List**:
 *   - Use the services we've defined to write the main program's business
 *     logic in the `main` Effect below
 *
 * **Business Logic**
 *   - For each misbehavior:
 *     - Use the `PunDistributionNetwork` to get a pun delivery channel
 *       for the pun
 *     - Use the `PunsterClient` to create a pun
 *     - Use the `PunDistributionNetwork` to deliver the pun to the delivery
 *       channel
 *     - Log out the result of delivering the pun
 *
 * **Hint**: You'll probably need to access the above services somehow!
 *
 * **Bonus Objectives**:
 *
 *   **Error Handling**:
 *     - Log a warning message if a child had an immunity token
 *     - Log an error message if a pun failed to be fetched from PUNSTER
 *
 *   **Other**:
 *     - Use the `ImmunityTokenManager` to give other children immunity
 *       - check `./fixtures/Misbehaviors.ts` to see the available children
